/**
 * Seeding database using `typeorm-seeding`
 *
 * README!
 * What is database seeding?
 * - Database seeding is the process of providing initial data to the database
 *   when the application (or database) is installed
 * - It is useful to populate lookup tables. Yes, you read it right, lookup tables data
 *   can be populated using both seed files and migration files.
 * - Seed files are also commonly used to populate data for development purpose.
 *
 * In this sprint, we are using `typeorm-seeding`, a library that fills the deficiency of `typeorm`
 * to seed our database.
